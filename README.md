nonshell for when you don't want a unix shell
---

this is not a shell program. you can assign it as login shell for users that want to login into system but do not run commands.

you can type in commands into it aaaaannd, it does nothing!

# just it?
well, kinda. you can configure it to do a bit more. it can have some special commands in it. also it can show a welcome message.
